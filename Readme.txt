Apparel Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of apparel data from the online section of a department store. Our goal is to uncover key insights and trends in the data, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions. We analyze various aspects, including sales records, production costs, ratings, and selling prices, using data visualization to provide clear and actionable insights.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Unique_id: Unique identifier for each record
Date: Record date
Name: Apparel name
Category: Apparel category (e.g., T-Shirt, Formal Shirt, Jeans)
Type: Type of apparel (e.g., shirt, pants)
Rating: Online rating of the apparel
Price: Selling price of the apparel
Production_Cost: Cost for manufacturing the apparel
Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
Date: Time-series data; conventional mean or median imputation is unsuitable. Instead, rows with missing values may be removed or handled using time-series techniques.
Rating: Missing values are imputed with the mode, as this is a categorical variable.
Price and Production_Cost: Median imputation is used for missing values, as it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.
Visualizations
We used Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations. Below are the main visualizations and insights:

Bar Chart: Displays the frequency of different apparel categories, highlighting higher sales frequencies for Jeans and T-Shirts compared to Formal Shirts.
Box Plot: Shows the distribution of selling prices for different categories, indicating most prices lie between $60 and $80.
Line Plot: Reveals fluctuations over time without a clear trend, suggesting other influencing factors.
Scatter Plot: Examines the relationship between production cost and selling price, indicating profit margins.
Histogram: Highlights the most frequent production cost range between $40 and $45.
Pie Charts: Show that T-shirts and Jeans dominate sales, while Formal Shirts represent the smallest share.
Heat Map: Visualizes seasonal sales trends, indicating a higher frequency of Jeans and T-Shirt sales during summer months.
Conclusion
The analysis reveals key insights into consumer buying habits:

Jeans and T-Shirts are the most popular categories, particularly during summer, suggesting seasonality impacts demand for casual apparel.
Formal Shirts maintain a steady but low sales volume throughout the year, indicating sustainability but limited profitability.
Profit Margins: Casual apparel like T-shirts and Jeans are generally profitable, as their production costs are lower than selling prices.
